# Project5

- The Trie class should use a seperate Trie.h and Trie.cpp file.
- The autocomplete program should be in a file named project5.cpp.
- Please zip your entire project directory into a single file called Project5.zip.
- Your trie will be evaluated using both your autocomplete program, and with a test harness, so be sure that your functions conform completely to the specifications in this assignment.

This project is worth 50 points, distributed as follows:
| Task                                                                                                                          | Points |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | 
|`Trie::insert` stores words correctly in the trie, and correctly rejects duplicate words|5|
|`Trie::count ` correctly returns the number of words in the trie |2|
|`Trie::getSize` correctly returns the number of nodes in the trie |4|
|`Trie::find` correctly determines if a word is present in the trie |4|
|`Trie::completeCount` correctly returns the number of words in the trie matching a given prefix 	|5|
|`Trie::complete` correctly returns a C++ vector of words (strings) that begin with the given prefix 	|5|
|`Trie::operator=` works correctly.|5|
| _Note that your code must implement an alphabet trie to get credit for any of the above items._ | |
|No memory leaks 	|5|
|Autocomplete program correctly reads user input, prints number of words that begin with the prefix, and outputs all words with the prefix. 	|5|
|Code is well organized, well documented, and properly formatted. Variable names are clear, and readable. Your AVLTree class is declared and implemented in separate (.cpp and .h) files. 	|5|
